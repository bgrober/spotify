### Pitch the idea in 1 sentence
Use data to find training partners that are at the same fitness level.

### What's the problem you're solving?

There is no good way for an endurance athlete to find a training partner. Joining a club often requires money, can be intimidating, and there may not even be a good one that is convenient. This app hopes to connect people so that they can train together, improve together, and have fun!

### Whose problem are you solving?

Endurance Athletes aka my own :)

### How are you solving the problem?

Using data the app will show users potential training partners that they can meet up with. It will use data the user already collects and run an alogrithm to determine a match on pace, distance, and location. 

### What's the most crucial feature?

The algorithm to match users.

### What are the core technologies you use?

I will use oauth to popular running apps (strava to start), store the data in a SQL database, a server to pull data from my database and push it to the front end framework, and React as my front end framework. 

### What's the least important feature?

Looks for now are of least importance. I will also have the algorithm start to work for just pace, and can expand from there.
